# ESP8266 WiFi Scanner

This project demonstrates a simple WiFi scanner using an ESP8266 microcontroller. It scans for available WiFi networks and prints their SSID, RSSI, and MAC address to the serial monitor.

## Hardware Requirements

*   ESP8266 development board (e.g., NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini)

## Software Requirements

*   Arduino IDE
*   ESP8266 board package installed in Arduino IDE (follow instructions [here](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

## Installation

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open the `esp8266_wifi_scan_new.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3.  Select your ESP8266 board and the correct port in the Arduino IDE (Tools > Board and Tools > Port).
4.  Upload the code to your ESP8266.
